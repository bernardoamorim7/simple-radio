# Simple Radio

A very simple radio app using Flutter that I made because my mom had some troubles with other apps.  
Feel free to send a PR or open an issue if you have any suggestions.

**Only tested on Android and Linux.**  
**All radios are from Portugal by default! If you wanna change that simply replace the country in the API call URL inside `utilities/config.dart`**
